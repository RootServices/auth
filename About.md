### Project Goal
Tokensmith is an open source OAuth2 and OIDC identity server. 
The project goal is to strictly implement the [OAuth 2.0](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) and [OIDC](https://openid.net/) RFCs to provide an alternative
Identity Server solution than the closed source counter-parts. 
While doing so being mindful of performance, security, testability, and ease of trouble shooting.
